Homework project

oh yeah baby! This was a super dope project. had tons of fun working on this, collaborating with some friends and the tutor.

I have firebase database storing the inputs from the form.
I used momentjs for the time calculations and stuff
I have a bunch of a grip of js and css files for the attempt of the departure board. (it was fun trying tho.)
